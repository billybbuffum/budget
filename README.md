# Budget App

A zero-based budgeting application that helps you take control of your finances by giving every dollar a job.

## What is Zero-Based Budgeting?

Zero-based budgeting is a method where you allocate all of your income to specific categories until you have zero dollars left unassigned. This approach helps you be intentional with your money and ensures every dollar has a purpose.

## What This App Does

Budget App helps you:

- **Track Your Money**: Manage multiple accounts (checking, savings, cash) and see your total balance
- **Categorize Your Spending**: Create custom categories for both income and expenses
- **Record Transactions**: Log every dollar that comes in and goes out
- **Allocate Your Budget**: Assign money to categories for each month using zero-based budgeting principles
- **Monitor Your Progress**: See how much you've budgeted, spent, and have available in each category

## Key Features

### Zero-Based Allocation
Assign all your available money to expense categories each month. The app shows you how much you have ready to assign and helps ensure every dollar has a purpose.

### Rollover Support
Didn't spend your entire grocery budget this month? That unused money automatically rolls over to the next month, giving you more flexibility.

### Clear Visibility
See at a glance:
- Your total account balances
- How much you've allocated to each category
- How much you've actually spent
- How much is left to assign

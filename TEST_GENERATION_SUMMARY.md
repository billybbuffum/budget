#### Test Scenarios

**TestCoverUnderfunded_RealtimeBudgeting**
- Tests the case where budget is allocated before spending

- Confirms CoverUnderfunded fails with "not underfunded" error

**TestCoverUnderfunded_RetroactiveFullyBudgeted**
- Spend $500 on CC without allocation
- Verify underfunded = $500
- Allocate $500 to expense category retroactively
- Verify underfunded = nil (Option A calculation fix!)
- Confirms proper handling of retroactive full budget

**TestCoverUnderfunded_RetroactivePartiallyBudgeted**
- Spend $500 on CC
- Allocate only $300 to expense category
- Verify underfunded = $200
- Cover underfunded successfully
- Verify payment allocation = $200
- Verify underfunded = nil after covering
- Verify total budget = $500 ($300 expense + $200 payment)

**TestCoverUnderfunded_InsufficientFunds**
- Spend $500 on CC
- Add only $200 income
- Verify underfunded = $500
- Attempt to cover fails with "insufficient funds: need 500 but only 200 available"

**TestCoverUnderfunded_MultipleCategories**
- Spend $300 on Groceries (fully allocated)
- Spend $200 on Gas ($100 allocated, $100 unbudgeted)
- Verify underfunded = $100
- Verify underfunded_categories = ["Gas"]
- Cover underfunded successfully
- Verify underfunded = nil after covering

**TestCoverUnderfunded_UpdatesExistingAllocation**
- Spend $500 on CC
- Manually allocate $200 to payment category
- Verify underfunded = $300
- Cover underfunded
- Verify payment allocation updated to $500 (not $200 + $300)
- Confirms upsert behavior (update existing allocation)

**Test Infrastructure:**
- setupTestDB() - Creates in-memory SQLite database
- initTestSchema() - Initializes complete database schema

  - `make test-coverage` - Generate coverage report
  - `make test-verbose` - Verbose output
  - `make test-race` - Race detection

## Test Statistics

### Total Test Coverage
- **Test Files:** 3
- **Test Functions:** 9
- **Test Cases (table-driven):** 25
- **Lines of Code:** ~1,800 lines

### Tests by Type
- **Unit Tests:** 2 functions, 11 cases
- **Handler Tests:** 1 function, 8 cases
- **Integration Tests:** 6 functions (end-to-end scenarios)

## Key Features Tested

### Business Logic (Unit Tests)
- Underfunded calculation (Option A implementation)
- Ready to Assign calculation with underfunded adjustment
- Payment category validation
- Allocation upsert logic (create or update)
- Multi-category underfunded tracking

### HTTP Layer (Handler Tests)
- Request validation (required fields)
- JSON parsing and error handling
- Error response status codes
- Success response structure
- Service layer integration

### Complete Workflows (Integration Tests)
- Real-time budgeting workflow
- Retroactive budgeting (full and partial)
- Insufficient funds handling
- Multiple categories with mixed budgeting
- Allocation update behavior

## Critical Scenarios Validated

### Option A Implementation
All tests validate the Option A underfunded calculation:
- **Unbudgeted debt = total CC spending - budgeted amount in expense categories**
- Only shows underfunded for truly unbudgeted spending
- Retroactive allocation correctly reduces underfunded amount

### Budget Integrity
Tests verify:
- No double-counting between expense and payment allocations
- Total budget correctly reflects expense allocations + payment allocations
- Ready to Assign properly accounts for underfunded amounts

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error scenarios:
- Invalid payment category
- Not a payment category
- Not underfunded (nothing to cover)
- Insufficient Ready to Assign funds
- Missing required fields

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage report
make test-coverage

# Run specific test type
make test-unit
make test-handler
make test-integration
```

### Manual Commands
```bash
# All tests
go test ./...

# With verbose output
go test ./... -v

# Specific test
go test ./internal/application -run TestAllocationService_CoverUnderfundedPayment -v

# With race detection
go test ./... -race

# With coverage
go test ./... -cover
```

## Dependencies

Required packages (already in go.mod):
- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` - SQLite driver for integration tests
- Standard library packages: `testing`, `context`, `database/sql`, etc.

No additional dependencies needed.

## Test Quality Metrics

### Coverage Goals
- **Unit Tests:** 80%+ coverage of AllocationService methods
- **Handler Tests:** 100% coverage of CoverUnderfunded endpoint
- **Integration Tests:** All critical user workflows covered

### Test Properties
- **Independent:** Tests don't depend on each other
- **Repeatable:** Same results every time
- **Fast:** Unit tests use mocks, integration tests use in-memory DB
- **Clear:** Descriptive test names and error messages
- **Comprehensive:** Happy path, errors, edge cases

## What's Tested vs. Not Tested

### Tested
- GetAllocationSummary underfunded calculation
- CoverUnderfundedPayment method
- CoverUnderfunded HTTP handler
- All validation and error cases
- Real-time vs. retroactive budgeting
- Multiple categories
- Allocation upsert behavior
- Budget integrity

### Not Yet Tested (Future Work)
- Concurrent access to allocations
- Performance under load
- Edge cases with very large amounts
- Period format validation edge cases
- Transaction rollback scenarios

## Next Steps

### To Run Tests
1. Navigate to project directory: `cd /home/user/budget`
2. Run tests: `make test` or `go test ./...`
3. View coverage: `make test-coverage` (opens coverage.html)

### To Add More Tests
1. Add test cases to existing test functions (table-driven pattern)
2. Create new test functions in existing files
3. Update TESTING.md with new test descriptions

### To Debug Failing Tests
1. Run with verbose output: `make test-verbose`
2. Run specific test: `go test ./... -run TestName -v`
3. Check test output for assertion failures
4. Review mock setup and expected values

## Notes

- All tests use in-memory SQLite database (no external dependencies)
- Mock repositories follow repository interface contracts
- Integration tests create fresh database for each test
- Helper functions (strPtr, int64Ptr, contains) provided for convenience
- Tests follow Go testing best practices (AAA pattern, table-driven tests)

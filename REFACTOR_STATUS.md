# Zero-Based Budgeting Refactor Status

## âœ… Completed

### Domain Layer
- [x] Account entity (checking/savings/cash with int64 balance in cents)
- [x] Allocation entity (money assigned to categories, rolls over)
- [x] Updated Transaction (uses account_id, int64 amounts in cents)
- [x] Updated Category (clarified income vs expense)
- [x] Removed User and Budget entities

### Database Schema
- [x] accounts table with INTEGER balance
- [x] allocations table (replaces budgets)
- [x] Updated transactions table (account_id, INTEGER amount)
- [x] Removed users and budgets tables

### Repository Layer
- [x] AccountRepository with GetTotalBalance()
- [x] AllocationRepository with GetTotalAllocated()
- [x] Updated TransactionRepository with GetCategoryActivity()
- [x] Removed UserRepository and BudgetRepository

### Application Layer
- [x] AccountService - manage accounts
- [x] AllocationService - **with rollover logic!**
  - Available = Sum(ALL allocations) - Sum(ALL transactions)
  - Period field is just for tracking/budgeting, not expiration
- [x] TransactionService - automatically updates account balances
- [x] CategoryService - kept simple for now

### HTTP Layer (Partial)
- [x] AccountHandler created
- [ ] AllocationHandler (TODO)
- [ ] TransactionHandler (TODO - needs rewrite for new model)
- [ ] CategoryHandler (TODO - reuse old one with minor tweaks)

## ðŸš§ TODO

### HTTP Handlers
1. Create AllocationHandler
2. Create TransactionHandler (updated for int64 cents, account_id)
3. Update CategoryHandler (minimal changes)
4. Create endpoint for "Ready to Assign" calculation

### Router
1. Remove /api/users and /api/budgets routes
2. Add /api/accounts routes
3. Add /api/allocations routes
4. Update /api/transactions routes
5. Update /api/categories routes (minimal)

### Main.go
1. Remove user service/handler initialization
2. Add account service/handler initialization
3. Add allocation service/handler initialization
4. Update transaction service initialization (needs accountRepo)
5. Update router initialization with new handlers

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Soft delete for categories (preserve history when deleted)
- [ ] "Months covered" calculation (how many months fully funded)
- [ ] Over-allocation warnings (Ready to Assign < 0)
- [ ] Transfer transactions (between accounts, neutral to allocations)

## Key Concepts

### Ready to Assign
```
Ready to Assign = Sum(Account Balances) - Sum(All Allocations)
```
Can go negative (warning state!)

### Category Available (with Rollover!)
```
Available = Sum(ALL allocations for category) - Sum(ALL spending for category)
```
NOT limited to one period - this enables rollover!

### Transaction Amounts
- Positive = Inflow (income, money coming in)
- Negative = Outflow (expense, money going out)
- Stored as int64 in cents (50000 = $500.00)

### Workflow Example
```
1. Add $5000 to checking account
2. Allocate $500 to Groceries-Nov
3. Allocate $1500 to Rent-Nov
4. Ready to Assign: $3000

5. Spend -$400 on groceries (Nov 15)
6. Groceries Available: $100 (rolls over!)

7. Allocate $500 more to Groceries-Dec
8. Groceries Available: $600 ($100 rollover + $500 new)
```

## Notes for Completion

The architecture is sound and the core business logic is complete. The remaining work is primarily:
1. Creating HTTP handlers (straightforward CRUD)
2. Wiring everything together in router and main.go
3. Testing the end-to-end flow

Estimated remaining work: ~2-3 hours to complete handlers, router, main.go and test.

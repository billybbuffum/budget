# Transaction Linking Feature - Test Results

## Summary
The transaction linking feature has been successfully implemented and tested. Core functionality is working as designed.

## Test Date
October 31, 2025

## Feature Status: ✅ WORKING

## Components Tested

### 1. Detection Algorithm ✅
- **Same-Day Transfers**: Detected with HIGH confidence (score: 18)
  - Opposite amounts (+$1000 / -$1000)
  - Same date
  - Transfer keywords in description
  - Different accounts

- **Delayed Transfers**: Detected with MEDIUM confidence (score: 13)
  - 1-day difference between transactions
  - Opposite amounts
  - Within ±3 day window

- **Credit Card Payments**: Detected with HIGH confidence (score: 21)
  - Correctly identified with `is_credit_payment: true`
  - Higher score due to CC-specific heuristics
  - Payment keywords detected

### 2. API Endpoints ✅
- **GET /api/transfer-suggestions**: Returns enriched suggestions with full transaction and account details
- **POST /api/transfer-suggestions/{id}/accept**: Successfully links transactions
- **POST /api/transfer-suggestions/{id}/reject**: (Not fully tested but endpoint exists)
- **POST /api/transactions/link**: Manual linking endpoint (Not fully tested)

### 3. Suggestion Format ✅
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "transaction_a": {...},
  "transaction_b": {...},
  "account_a": {...},
  "account_b": {...},
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "score": 18,
  "is_credit_payment": false,
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2025-10-31..."
}
```

### 4. Accept Flow ✅
When a suggestion is accepted:
1. Both transactions are converted to `type: "transfer"`
2. `transfer_to_account_id` is set on both transactions
3. Transactions are properly linked bidirectionally
4. Suggestion is marked as accepted
5. Other suggestions involving these transactions are deleted

**Verified Output:**
```json
{
  "id": "b987c914-b59d-4f33-8782-322d165d5601",
  "type": "transfer",
  "account_id": "ee98ce85-2c72-4932-a34e-de98d6a41230",
  "transfer_to_account_id": "ccfa279a-af1f-4bd1-87fe-2f7fbb7ca4b6",
  "amount": 100000,
  "description": "Transfer from Chase - Mortgage payment received",
  "date": "2025-10-28T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Key Test Scenarios (from spec)

| Scenario | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 1. Same-day transfer | ✅ PASS | High confidence, score 18 |
| 2. Delayed transfer (1 day) | ✅ PASS | Medium confidence, score 13 |
| 3. Delayed transfer (3 days) | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | Should work (within window) |
| 4. Outside date window (4+ days) | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | Should not match |
| 5. Credit card payment (same day) | ✅ PASS | High confidence, score 21, flagged as CC |
| 6. Credit card payment (delayed) | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | Should work |
| 7. CC overpayment | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | Should not apply payment category |
| 8. Async imports | ✅ PASS | Works regardless of import timing |
| 9-16. Various edge cases | ⚠️ NOT FULLY TESTED | Core algorithm working |
| 17. Accept suggestion | ✅ PASS | Successfully links transactions |
| 18. Reject suggestion | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | Endpoint exists |
| 19. Manual link | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | Endpoint exists |
| 20. FitID duplicate detection | ✅ PASS | Import reports skipped duplicates |

## Bugs Fixed During Testing

### Bug 1: Missing Status Field
- **Issue**: `status` field was null in API responses
- **Cause**: `SuggestionWithDetails` struct missing `Status` field
- **Fix**: Added `Status` field to struct and populated it in handler
- **File**: `internal/infrastructure/http/handlers/transfer_suggestion_handler.go:42`

### Bug 2: Accept Endpoint Routing
- **Issue**: Initial confusion about accept not working
- **Cause**: Test script variable scoping issues
- **Resolution**: Fixed test scripts, endpoint working correctly

## Performance Notes
- Matcher runs automatically after each import
- Suggestions created in real-time
- No noticeable performance impact on imports

## Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE transfer_match_suggestions (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_a_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    transaction_b_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    confidence TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(confidence IN ('high', 'medium', 'low')),
    score INTEGER NOT NULL,
    is_credit_payment BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    reviewed_at DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (transaction_a_id) REFERENCES transactions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (transaction_b_id) REFERENCES transactions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE(transaction_a_id, transaction_b_id)
);
```

## Scoring Algorithm

| Factor | Points | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Same day | +10 | Date match |
| 1 day apart | +5 | Close timing |
| 2-3 days apart | +2 | Within window |
| Transfer keywords | +5 | "transfer", "payment", etc. |
| Round amount ($.00) | +3 | Even dollar amounts |
| Credit card account | +5 | One account is type=credit |
| Payment keywords | +3 | "payment", "autopay", etc. |

**Confidence Levels:**
- High: score ≥ 15
- Medium: score 10-14
- Low: score < 10

## Conclusions

### What Works ✅
1. Automatic detection during import
2. Scoring algorithm with multiple heuristics
3. Confidence level classification
4. Credit card payment detection
5. Accept suggestion flow with proper linking
6. Async import support
7. FitID duplicate detection
8. API endpoints returning proper data
9. Database schema and migrations

### What Needs More Testing ⚠️
1. Reject suggestion flow
2. Manual linking
3. Edge cases (overpayments, false positives)
4. Cross-month transfers
5. Multiple suggestions for same transaction
6. UI integration and user experience

### Recommendations
1. Add more comprehensive automated tests
2. Test reject and manual link flows
3. Add UI polish and user feedback
4. Consider adding confidence score explanations in UI
5. Add analytics to track acceptance rates

## Overall Assessment
**Feature Status: PRODUCTION READY (Core functionality)**

The core transaction linking feature is working correctly and ready for use. The detection algorithm, suggestion creation, and accept flow all work as designed. Additional testing of edge cases and full UI testing would increase confidence for production deployment.
